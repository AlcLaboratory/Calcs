**The Calcs**

The Calcs (this is a working name) is a mobile app which allow you to create your own diet or use one of a diet from our database.
For example: 5:2 diet, IF 16/8 diet, balanced diet.
You can easly set different calories/proteins/fats/carbs goals for each day.

**A Example:**

 You use the Carb Cycling Diet and you have three types of day in one week:
  - high carb day
  - medium carb day
  - low carb day
  
  For every day you have different goals for calories and carbs.
  This app will help you with that.
  
  
  The application is using the Nativescript (5.4 version) and the Angular (7.2 version).
  
  **How to run this app?**
  - install Nativescript CLI: https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli
  - clone the repository
  - run npm install
  - run tns doctor
  - run tns platform add android
  - npm run android
  
  
 However, the app is still in the early stage. Right now, I'm working on the design and the diets list (CRUD feautures).
 I want to add the connection with the MyFitnessPal later.

**The Calcs**

The Calcs (this is a working name) is a mobile app which allow you to create your own diet or use one of a diet from our database.
For example: 5:2 diet, IF 16/8 diet, balanced diet.
You can easly set different calories/proteins/fats/carbs goals for each day.

**A Example:**

 You use the Carb Cycling Diet and you have three types of day in one week:
  - high carb day
  - medium carb day
  - low carb day
  
  For every day you have different goals for calories and carbs.
  This app will help you with that.
  
  
  The application is using the Nativescript (5.4 version) and the Angular (7.2 version).
  
  **How to run this app?**
  - install Nativescript CLI: https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli
  - clone the repository
  - run npm install
  - run tns doctor
  - run tns platform add android
  - npm run android
  
  
 However, the app is still in the early stage.
 
 **TODO List**
 - a validation in a diets list
 - notifications after saving/removing a diet
 - push notifications
 - saving diets in the memory
 - connection with the MyFitnessPal
 - improve the desing (icons, colors e.t.c)
 
 **Might TODO list**
 - translates with i18n - it's not important right now because english version probably will be the only version
 - refactor - change ngModel to FormGroup. I don't think this is important and necessary
